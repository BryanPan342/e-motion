Welcome to my portfolio! I built it completely through React and Sass.

## Getting Started

We use [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) as our package manager.

The basic commands to get this repository and start are:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BryanPan342/e-motion.git
$ cd e-motion
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
